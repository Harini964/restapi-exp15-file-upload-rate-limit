This page is served at `http://localhost:3000/`.  
It provides a simple HTML form where users can choose a file from their local system and submit it to the server. The file input is handled by **Multer middleware** in the backend.

After selecting a file and clicking **Upload**, the file is stored inside the serverâ€™s `uploads/` folder.  
The success page (`/upload` route) confirms the upload and displays the newly generated filename (timestamp + original extension).
